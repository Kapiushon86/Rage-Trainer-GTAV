Rage Trailer was a GTA V sp simple mod menu i developed for the lemmon ui framework a few years back when i was alot less experienced and dumb. Its primary language is coded in C# it includes all your basic features like god mode, sumper jump, infinite ammo, give all weapons, spawn all vehicles etc at that given time, have not worked on this menu since i created it basically. I am releasing the source code simply because I have no use for it so if you find this and either want to compile and use it go ahead or if you just want to upload it to some site and saying you made it crediting yourself go ahead i couldnt care less. Enjoy or dont. Have a nice day. Its all done in one file to so that makes it a pain over 5k lines of code.
