RageTrainer is a simple trainer I made a long time ago using the Lemon UI framework. After thinking it over, I’ve decided I won’t be updating or maintaining this project anymore.

The main reason is that C# just isn’t great for mod development—it has too many limitations that hold back what’s possible.

I’m making the project open source, so if anyone wants to update it, add features, or mess around with it, they can. From now on, any updates or changes are up to whoever feels like doing it.

You can find the source code here:
RageTrainer on NexusMods

I’m focusing on my new project now, RageMenu, a mod menu for Red Dead Redemption 2 made in C++. C++ gets rid of the limits I ran into with C#, so I’m excited to see where it goes.

Thanks to everyone who used RageTrainer!

Also ps its not that well organized lol.
